Client: TerraCloud Hosting  
Team: Infrastructure Engineering  
Onboarding Date: May 2025  

Feedback Summary:
Our team recently completed the onboarding process for the TerraCloud Kubernetes Gateway, and we wanted to provide consolidated feedback from the infrastructure and DevOps stakeholders.

The provisioning workflow was smooth once we got access. However, several areas caused friction:

- IAM policy setup is poorly documented for federated SSO users — especially when provisioning multiple namespaces.
- The Terraform module you provide lacks lifecycle hooks for some post-deployment configuration.
- Dashboard UX is overly minimal: important status indicators (like health checks) are nested 3 clicks deep.

Suggestions:
- Add a quickstart guide focused on multi-tenant customers
- Support Slack-based alerting in addition to email
- Publish Grafana templates for the Prometheus metrics you expose

That said, your support engineer (Zainab Khan) was phenomenal and walked our team through 3 critical issues on a single Zoom call. We’re cautiously optimistic and happy to be a design partner for the next release.
