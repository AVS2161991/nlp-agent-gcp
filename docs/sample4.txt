Product: Horizon Earbuds Pro

The Horizon Earbuds Pro are a classic case of brilliant hardware with sloppy software. Let me start with the good:

Sound quality is exceptional — easily comparable to AirPods Pro or Sony WF-1000XM5. The bass is punchy but doesn’t drown mids, and the spatial audio is genuinely immersive during Zoom calls.

Battery life lives up to claims: 6 hours with ANC, ~30 hours with the case.

Call quality has improved since the April firmware patch.

But the downsides:

The companion app is buggy and freezes during firmware installs. I’ve had to reinstall 3 times this month alone.

Bluetooth multi-device support is inconsistent — switching between my Pixel 8 and work MacBook is hit-or-miss.

No integration with Google Assistant, which seems like a missed opportunity.

Would I buy again? Probably. Would I recommend to less tech-savvy users? Not without some serious fixes. My rating would be 3.5/5, rounded to 4 because of how good the hardware is.
