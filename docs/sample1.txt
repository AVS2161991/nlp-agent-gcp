Subject: Extremely poor battery performance over the last few months

Hi Team,

I’m writing to express my continued frustration with the battery performance of the SmartTrack 2.0 wristband. I initially purchased this device in January 2025, attracted by the marketing claims of a 5-day battery life. However, since April, I’ve seen significant degradation. The device now barely lasts 14 hours on a full charge. I've followed all troubleshooting steps: resetting the device, disabling background heart rate sync, and switching to power-saving mode. None of these have resolved the issue.

I reached out to support twice already, and while I received polite responses, no meaningful solution was provided. I'm also part of a user group on Reddit, and it seems like at least 25 other users are reporting identical issues — mostly from the latest firmware version released in March. If the firmware is indeed the cause, this needs to be escalated.

This is unacceptable for a device at this price point. Please let me know if there are any official statements, plans to patch the firmware, or eligibility for replacement units. I’m still within warranty.

Sincerely,
Natalie M.
