Case ID: 5721839  
Customer: GreenLeaf Logistics  
Date: July 2, 2025  

Ticket Summary:
Client has experienced persistent API downtime during peak batch windows (between 9–11am PST) for the past 8 days. This issue began after migration to v3.5 of the billing microservice, with intermittent HTTP 503 errors and latency spikes above 4 seconds per request.

Timeline:
- June 25: Upgrade to v3.5 completed. Monitoring shows healthy.
- June 27–29: First 503 spikes reported by internal tooling.
- June 30: Support ticket opened (#5719230), auto-closed due to inactivity.
- July 1: Customer reopens ticket. Logs shared. No resolution.
- July 2: Issue escalated by account manager Priya Mehta.

Next Steps:
- Requesting engineering triage to determine if v3.5 rollback is safe.
- Possible connection with internal load balancing pool timeout misconfig.

Impact: Client unable to complete invoicing process before cutoff window; financial loss estimated at $8,000/day.

Urgency: Critical
